I have this ansible task that executes the splunk forwarder service to verify it is running.  When I do it in powershell it works, it says Running but doing it in ansible fail.
- name: Get splunk forwarder
      ansible.windows.win_command: Get-Service -Name Splunkforwarder

Why am I getting a failure?
