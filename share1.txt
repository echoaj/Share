I have an ACAS server at 192.168.5.55 and I use NESSUS to scan a target windows machine at 192.168.5.77 to check for vulnerabilities.
What I do is go to 192.168.5.55:8843 to the Nessus GUI sign in and perform the scan on 192.168.5.77 then I generate a Report that shows the complete list of vulnerabilities by host.

Now what I want to do is do this exact same thing but through the terminal.  Can I automate this?
