I have an ACAS server at 192.168.5.55 and I use NESSUS to scan a target windows machine at 192.168.5.77 to check for vulnerabilities.

I am testing out the API.  I already generated API keys for my ISSO user, as admin I enabled API keys in the configuration settings.
Now I am doing this command but it does not work:
curl -X GET -k --header "x-apikey: accesskey=4def6bc216f14c1ab86dfba8738ff4a5; secretkey=a47d1d3a071443449a75821129526b96" https://192.168.5.55/rest/isso

I get the error;
{"type":"regular","response":"","error_code":74,"error_msg":"API Key login denied.\n","warnings":[],"timestamp":1770234339}
