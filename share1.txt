Ok so at our company we use vsphere/vcenter/esxi for out virtualization environment. 
We have two domain controllers in a management cluster that are on VMXNET3 network adapter

Then we have a ton of VMs on another cluster called SSB.
We have two network adapters, one called virtual_22 and another called Trellix_NA
We have 100 VMs 80 of them aare on virtual_22 the other 20 are on Trellix_NA
I checked the configuration (properties, policies, nsx config, traffic filtering etc...), permissions, and both network adapters are essentially identically configured.
The VMs on virtual_22 have access to our windows file share, my ansible scripts from my workstation can reach them
However the VMs on Trellix_NA don't have access to the file share and my scripts can't be reached

What do you think is the problem, are the network adapters not configured correctly? Is it an issue with the Domain Controller.  How do I get Trellix_NA to also have access to everything virtual_22 does?
