I am trying to connect a client machine to active directory but I am having problems

both machines are on the same subnet mask, both have the same default gateway, both machines can ping eachother, both are on the same network adapter,
On the client machine under advanced settings i set the Domain to cybrlab.local and it looks like the domain can not be contacted.
What could be the issue?
