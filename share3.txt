I have so ansible code below.  I am able to create a user account but I can't figure out how to then log in using that user account.  I keep getting errors.
The error reads as follow:
'
ERROR! conflicting action statements: ansible.windows.win_shell, become_password

The error appears to be in '/home/n29392/cs2/windows-workstation/tasks/access-restrictions-role-based-access--restrict-software-from-executing-at-higher-privilege-than-executing-user.yaml': line 34, column 7, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:


    - name: Show who I am as the temporary user
      ^ here"
'

This is the ansible code I have below
