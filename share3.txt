This is what my inventory file looks like:
; RUNNING PLAYBOOKls
; source ~/ansible/bin/activate
; ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml

[windows-workstation]
192.168.5.11                                    # vSphere: Win wrks 10

[windows-workstation:vars]
ansible_user = Administrator
ansible_password = Password.123
ansible_connection = winrm
ansible_become = yes
ansible_become_method = runas
ansible_become_user = Administrator
ansible_become_flags = 'logon_type=interactive logon_flags=with_profile'
ansible_winrm_port = 5986                       # May need to change to 5985 if it doesn't work
ansible_winrm_transport = ntlm
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation = ignore
ansible_winrm_read_timeout_sec = 60


Looks like that solved my previous error but Now I get the error:
An exception occurred during task execution. To see the full traceback, use -vvv. The error was:    at System.Management.Automation.Interpreter.EnterTryCatchFinallyInstruction.Run(InterpretedFrame frame)
fatal: [192.168.5.11]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "msg": "internal error: failed to become user 'Administrator': Exception calling \"CreateProcessAsUser\" with \"9\" argument(s): \"Failed to logon .\\Administrator (The user name or password is incorrect, Win32ErrorCode 1326 - 0x0000052E)\""}



I have so ansible code below.  I am able to create a user account but I can't figure out how to then log in using that user account.  I keep getting errors.
The error reads as follow:
'
ERROR! conflicting action statements: ansible.windows.win_shell, become_password

The error appears to be in '/home/n29392/cs2/windows-workstation/tasks/access-restrictions-role-based-access--restrict-software-from-executing-at-higher-privilege-than-executing-user.yaml': line 34, column 7, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:


    - name: Show who I am as the temporary user
      ^ here"
'

This is the ansible code I have below
