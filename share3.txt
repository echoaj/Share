I am using ansible to perform cyber security checks on windows 10 virtual machine
I am automating the following requirement:
The Windows Operating System Workstation shall generate an event log for failed directory access


Here is the code I have so far.
---
- tags: 
    - req1-SDSO-8167
    - SDSO-8167
  block:
    - name: The Windows Operating System Workstation shall generate an event log for failed directory access
      ansible.builtin.meta: noop

    - name: Create directory in C:\
      ansible.builtin.win_file: 
        path: C:\Directory
        state: directory

    - name: Set directory security properties
      ansible.builtin.win_audit_rule:
        path: C:\Directory
        user: Administrators
        principal: Everyone
        rights: FullControl
        audit_flags: failure
    
    - name: Set deny permissions on user
      ansible.builtin.win_acl:
        path: C:\Directory
        user: Administrators
        rights: 'FullControl'
        type: 'deny'

I believe my next step to have ansible attempt to open the directory as the Administrator.  Clearly we will get an error since the Administrator does not have permission.  Then Ansible should find if a 4656 File System security event log was generated. It should find the keyword "Audit Failure" and "Access Reasons" should contain the word "Denied" in it.  If so this requirement passes, otherwise it does not.  Are you able to generate the rest of the ansible code to complete this requirement?
