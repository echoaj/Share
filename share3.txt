I have a cyber verification ticket on IAM software (Active Directory).  
We use AD and have multiple windows machines within the domain with multiple domain user accounts etc...
Here are the requirements

- Req1. The IAM software shall allow for auditing of domain group accounts.
- Req2. The IAM software shall allow for auditing of domain user accounts.

What do these requirements mean and how would I write an verification guide procedure on it?
