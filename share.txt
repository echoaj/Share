I have an ESXi server setup.  There is not a single VM on it but I did upload a redhat linux machine, ubuntu, windows 11, and windows server 2022 to the data store. My goal is to setup a virtual environment on ESXi with 40 node vms, 2 switches and a router.  The reason why I am doing this is because I will test a Network Monitoring solution like TotalView from pathsolutions on it.  The Netowrk Monitoring tool will essentially do network discovery and connect to these devices using snmp and probably other protocols.  I want to ensure I connect everything properly so I can accuratly test the network monitoring tool.  How do I setup these VMs with the right network configuration so I have an exceptional test environment.  Do I need to do any network configuration stuff on ESXi as well?  Please give me a step to step guide on how to set this up.


I have an ESXi server setup.  I can access the ESXi client by opening up a borwser on my machine and going to 10.1.90.138.  I created a windows machine with it and it's IP is at 169.254.114.240. From my machine I am able to ping the ESXi server but not the 169.254.114.240 vm.  Why?  Also I wish to transfer a software installer to the windows vm but I don't know how to do that.  I assume if I can't even get ping to work I won't be able to tranfer the file. Help me
