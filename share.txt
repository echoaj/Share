Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 redistributable is a package of components and libraries that are required to run applications developed using Visual C++ on a computer that doesn't have Visual C++ 2017 installed. It provides the necessary runtime components to ensure compatibility and proper functioning of applications built with Visual C++ 2017. These redistributable packages are often distributed alongside software installations to ensure the required dependencies are met for the application to run successfully.
