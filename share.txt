I am going to Write a message to a my Manager (James) about our team lead (Colis). To give you context we working in Cyber Secuirty engineering. I along with other have been on the team for 2 years and Colis came in as our new lead about 4 months ago. At first things we good but lately there has been some passive aggressiveness and comments Colis has made that sounds degrading to the team. Such as suggesting we are technicians instead of engineers, his comments about hand holding, and general comments that give the impression he views the team as below him and helping us out is a chore. The team dynamic has been very tense the past few months but it's to the point that we really feel this needs to be resolved. I've let a lot of these comments slide but what crossed the line for me is on Wednesday after I had asked him for clarification a requirement, I noticed he wrote in the description of a Jira ticket "Due to low Cyber Security experience on the Cyber team, team members need to be trained on how to perform various Cyber Security Tasks". That’s statement that we have Low cyber security experience is insulting and the rest of the team agrees.  It really feels like it undermines the hard work we have put in the last 2 years and I think that’s just unfair.  The reason why I bring this up is because I don't want anyone on the team to come into work demoralized or not valued. It's been stressful for me as well and I just want to be able to keep getting my tickets done. I really don't want anyone on the team to feel alienated or not valued, including Colis. If Colis feels out of place with the team then that’s equally as important and I want him to feel comfortable.  I am definitely up for talking about this further if you would like. (Aldo and Tan as well). I have some ideas of how we can make the team dynamic better. I don't want to stress you out either sir about this but I just felt it was right thing to do to at least bring this up to your attention. Thank you as always for your support.
