I have a windowws server 2022 that servers as a gitlab runner.  In that machine I mapped a network drive to Z:\
When I open up PowerShell I am able to execute the command "dir Z:\" and I can see all the contents

Now I have that same command in my .gitlab-ci.yml file but when the pipeline runs it, it says "Cannot find drive. A drive with the name 'Z' does nto exist."
What is happening here?
