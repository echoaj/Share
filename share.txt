Req2.  The Windows Operating System Workstation shall allow for analyzing of user account activities.

Req3.  The Windows Operating System Workstation shall allow for auditing of local security event logs.

Req4.  The Windows Operating System Workstation shall allow for level adjustments of audit review, analysis, and reporting.

Req5.  The Windows Operating System Workstation shall allow for local audit logs to be processed by specific events of interests.

Req6.  The Windows Operating System Workstation shall allow for tailored auditing analysis of limited specific set of events.

Req7.  The Windows Operating System Workstation shall employ automated tools to support near real-time analysis of security related events.

For each requirement give me a detailed step by step guide on how to verify that each one is implemented.




Here is a step-by-step guide for verifying the implementation of each requirement in your cybersecurity task for Windows Operating System Workstations.

Req1: Verify Auditing of Denied Network Traffic Event Logs

	1.	Enable Firewall Logging:
	•	Open the Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.
	•	Go to Monitoring > Security Logging.
	•	Enable logging for both successful connections and dropped packets under the firewall’s properties.
	2.	Enable Audit Policy for Network Traffic:
	•	Open Local Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc).
	•	Navigate to: Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > Audit Policies.
	•	Enable Audit Network Policy Server and Audit Filtering Platform Connection.
	3.	Check the Logs:
	•	Use Event Viewer to go to Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Windows Firewall with Advanced Security.
	•	Look for denied connections to confirm that network traffic events are being logged.

Req2: Verify User Account Activity Auditing

	1.	Enable Account Logon Auditing:
	•	Open Local Group Policy Editor.
	•	Navigate to Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > Account Logon.
	•	Enable Audit Logon Events and Audit Account Logon (for both success and failure).
	2.	Review Logs for Account Activities:
	•	Open Event Viewer and navigate to Windows Logs > Security.
	•	Look for event IDs related to user account activities:
	•	Event ID 4624: Successful account logon.
	•	Event ID 4625: Failed account logon.
	•	Event ID 4720: User account creation.
	•	Event ID 4726: User account deletion.

Req3: Verify Auditing of Local Security Event Logs

	1.	Enable Local Security Event Auditing:
	•	Open Local Group Policy Editor.
	•	Navigate to Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > Object Access.
	•	Enable Audit Security Group Management and Audit Policy Change.
	2.	Verify Security Event Logs:
	•	Open Event Viewer and navigate to Windows Logs > Security.
	•	Check for event IDs related to local security events:
	•	Event ID 5136: Security group management changes.
	•	Event ID 4719: System audit policy change.

Req4: Verify Level Adjustments of Audit Review, Analysis, and Reporting

	1.	Adjust Audit Policies:
	•	Open Local Group Policy Editor.
	•	Navigate to Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > Audit Policies.
	•	Review and adjust the policies for specific auditing events, such as logon, account management, object access, and policy changes.
	2.	Verify in Event Viewer:
	•	Open Event Viewer.
	•	Review logs under Windows Logs > Security to ensure changes in audit levels reflect in the logs.
	3.	Set Up Filters in Event Viewer:
	•	In Event Viewer, right-click the Security log and click Filter Current Log.
	•	Adjust filters based on the level of auditing you wish to review (e.g., by Event ID or keywords).

Req5: Verify Processing of Specific Events of Interest

	1.	Create Custom Audit Policies:
	•	Open Local Group Policy Editor.
	•	Navigate to Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration.
	•	Define policies under Object Access or Logon/Logoff for specific events of interest.
	2.	Set Up Event Viewer Filters:
	•	Open Event Viewer and navigate to Windows Logs > Security.
	•	Right-click and select Create Custom View to filter specific events of interest.
	3.	Monitor for Specific Event IDs:
	•	Define specific event IDs related to your needs (e.g., 4624 for successful logons, 4656 for access to sensitive objects).
	•	Validate that the workstation is processing these logs by monitoring these specific IDs.

Req6: Verify Tailored Auditing Analysis of Limited Specific Set of Events

	1.	Customize Event Logs:
	•	Open Local Group Policy Editor.
	•	Navigate to Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration.
	•	Customize the audit policy to only enable specific events (e.g., account logon events, policy changes, etc.).
	2.	Set Up Tailored Event Viewer Filters:
	•	Open Event Viewer.
	•	Create custom views by filtering based on event IDs or categories relevant to specific audits.
	3.	Export Tailored Logs:
	•	In Event Viewer, use Save Filtered Logs to export logs for a tailored set of events.
	•	Verify that only the desired events are being captured in the logs.

Req7: Verify Automated Tools for Near Real-Time Analysis of Security Events

	1.	Enable Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP):
	•	Open Windows Security Center and configure Windows Defender ATP for near real-time monitoring.
	2.	Set Up Automated Alerts:
	•	Configure Task Scheduler or System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) to monitor for specific event IDs and trigger automated responses.
	3.	Implement SIEM Tools:
	•	Integrate with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution like Splunk, Azure Sentinel, or LogRhythm.
	•	Configure near real-time event processing rules to monitor specific security events.
	•	Validate the system’s capability to trigger alerts and log security events within seconds of their occurrence.

By following these steps, you should be able to verify each requirement is properly implemented.
