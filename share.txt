I have a some CI code on gitlab that runs on a windows gitlab runner whos hostname is "win10runner".  My CI code installs software on a Windows 10 virtual machine whos hostname is "win10cots".  Everything was working until I implemented a STIG on win10cots that turns off basic authentication for WinRM on the win10cots machine.  Now my gitlab runner can't connect to the win10cots machine.  It just hangs.  I did some research and I generated a self-signed certificate on the win10cots machine and created an https listner for the WinRM service.  In terms of configuration for the win10cots, I think I am done.  Is that correct?  If so what do I need to do now?  Do I need to change my gitlab CI code or configure something with the gitlab runner?  Or add the same certificate to the gitlab runner?
