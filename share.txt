I working with a WSUS and there is a patch I am expecting to recieve this month called
2024-10 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1809 for x64-based Systems (KB5044277)

According to the microsoft website, it says to download this patch you must have this configuration:
This update will automatically sync with Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) if you configure Products and Classifications as follows:
Product: Windows 10
Classification: Security Updates

I indeed have this set up on the WSUS and I do receive many October patches except the one mentioned above?
Why is this happening?
