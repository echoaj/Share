I’ve actually been wanting to talk about this with you for a while, since around February.  I’ve gotten to the point where I think I need to speak up about this.  The person I am referring to is my team lead Zaid.  I’ve got to warn you there are a lot of layers to his but I guess I will start from the very beginning.  So I remember the first day I met Zaid I knew something was a little off when I saw him in person, he gives me this big hug, says he is going to buy me subway, we get into his Tesla and he speeds down there really fast.  To me it seemed he was trying hard to gain my admiration.  As we are eating there are two ladies walking on the parking lot and he starts whistling and catcalling him.  It was really cringy and awkward and I had just met him an hour ago and he is already catcalling women in front of me?  And it’s not the first time he does that.  Just a few weeks ago I am driving, Zaid is in the passenger side seat, Aldo and Tony are in the back and as we are stopping at a stop sign, 3 girls are crossing the crosswalk and Zaid sticks his head out the window catcalls the girls very loudly calling them beautiful or whatever they looked pretty young.  Me, Aldo, and Tony were like I’m pretty sure those were high school girls and he was like oh what really?  I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt that he wasn’t paying attention and he didn’t know but still not only is that degrading, insulting, and rude to do towards women but it’s also very stupid.  That’s called sexual harassment and you can get into serious trouble at work for that.  Not to mention all the awkward times he tells us during team meetings all the girls he meets that he wants do.  It’s like he is trying hard to impress the boys.  So that’s one layer to this.  

Another layer to this is was what I believed to be his poor work ethic but I now think it goes much deeper than that.  So I joined the team like the 1st week of January and Zaid around 2 week after me.  Not gonna lie, it was really stressful at first for all of us but anytime someone was asking about our pipeline and he didn’t know he would make the excuse “the project was dumped” on me.  He used that excuse for like 2 months and I kept thinking in my head “man, I stopped using that excuse after my first 2 weeks”.  At that point, he just wanted anyway to deflect accountability. There was a lot of handholding we had to do.  Never was he ever interested in getting to the nitty-gritty of how things worked on a technical level.  Any work that would fall on his plate he would assign to us (typically me), even simple things like unblocking someone, onboarding someone to the team, and working on our demo PowerPoint.  Just like simple things a team lead would do he would not do.  We had a demo coming up for our pipeline and it was very hard to get him to participate.  When I asked him to do the “vision” portion of the PowerPoint he didn’t want to do it and wanted Tony to help out with that but Tony barely even knew how the pipeline worked since it was his 4th day with us. I finally got Zaid to do it but he complained the whole way there.  I remember this one time we had a meeting to preparing for the demo and Zaid calls in on his phone getting a haircut during the meeting.  It was ridiculous.  When he was doing unclass work there is no way he was working 10 hours per day Mon-Thurs.  Now I think he does because he is forced to work inside and James is always there.  Also when it came to creating Jira tickets it would always be me coming up with them and figuring out what we could work on.  Of course if Aldo and Tony would create tickets on their own as well if they needed to but almost never did Zaid come up with work for us to do.  At the time I just figured it was just because he wasn’t very good with Jira, or that he is just a slow typer since he told me he was taking a course to learn how to type without looking at the keyboard, or simply because he was lazy.  But to this day I am still the one creating tickets for us the majority of the time and he always says to mark him as the assignee.  Also, I am almost always the one driving when we have sprint planning meetings.  And now I’v realized that the reason why he has me doing this goes far beyond the he just doesn’t want to.


Which bring me to the next layer.  He does everything in his power to avoid responsibility so when things go wrong, he can blame it on others.  Just the other day, there was a VM that we exported for a team that didn’t have upgraded COTS on it, he went straight to my cubicle with Tony and basically interrogated me on why that is.  It was stressful the manner he was approaching me. And when we had a meeting with Aldo to figure out what’s going on he said comments like “I am surprised you weren’t tracking that”, “at least 1 person in this team knows what is going on”, “are you sleeping?”.  After all he is the team lead so why isn’t he tracking that, why didn’t he do any verifications on his end before the release?  He needs a person to blame it on.  And I think that’s why I am ultimately the one creating the Jira tickets because if something goes wrong, I am responsible for what is going on.

Now here is the twist which beings me to the next layer
I don’t think he minds that I lead as long as he is able to take credit for it, but as soon as he sees me leading in front of others outside the team that is when he views me as a threat.  There have been 2 occasions where he had issues with me in this regard, and he called me up 1 on 1 essentially furious that I was stepping on his turf.  During those 1 on 1s he alluded that I think I am “hot shit” and a know it all and also said he had an issue with Alex Vu and that he “told it to his face” about something.  He was basically trying to intimidate me. And since he is very good at talking he basically dominated those 1 on 1 conversations, and it was just me apologizing at the end. He’s very good at gaslighting.

Which brings me to my next point.  His character.
It’s not that the problem with Zaid is simply that he is an asshole and that’s it.  It’s more dangerous than that because he is both euphoric and awful. So when it comes to dealing with him, it becomes confusing.  Cause on the one hand he does these terrible things like badmouths colleagues, makes snarky comments, intimidates, prays on you mannerism ect… and on the other hand he will compliment the heck out of you, brings you gifts, gets you food.  So this makes you question your sanity, am I the wrong one here?  He’s being nice, he is smiling at me, maybe I am just misinterpreting the situation.  It took me several conversations with different colleagues to realize I am not going crazy and that his behavior is inappropriate. So I am worried that he is going create an environment, of fear, anxiety, and distrust.
