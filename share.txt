The requirements outlined in SDSO-3532 are identical to those already addressed in SDSO-3400, which focused on Windows Workstation. Both workstation and server environments inherit the same Domain policies and maintain consistent functionality regarding Local Role-Based Access. The implementation and policies for Local Role-Based Access do not differ between the two systems. Comprehensive evidence for the workstation implementation has been detailed in SDSO-3400, and therefore, SDSO-3532 can be marked as complete.
