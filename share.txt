I have an ESXi server setup.  There is not a single VM on it but I did upload a redhat linux machine, ubuntu, windows 11, and windows server 2022 to the data store. My goal is to setup a virtual environment on ESXi with 40 node vms, 2 switches and a router.  The reason why I am doing this is because I will test a Network Monitoring solution like TotalView from pathsolutions on it.  The Netowrk Monitoring tool will essentially do network discovery and connect to these devices using snmp and probably other protocols.  I want to ensure I connect everything properly so I can accuratly test the network monitoring tool.  How do I setup these VMs with the right network configuration so I have an exceptional test environment.  Do I need to do any network configuration stuff on ESXi as well?  Please give me a step to step guide on how to set this up.
