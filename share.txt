I want you to write powershell code that takes the variable ISO_PATH which is set to \\10.10.21.84\share\pipe\E-Team\Windows\Test-WS22\5.5.5\20231012-151433\EXPORT-Test-WS22-5.5.5-20231012-151433.iso and create a new variable called WIN_DESC and set it equal to "Windows Server 2019 Standard" if ISO_PATH contains w19, W19, ws19 or WS19.
