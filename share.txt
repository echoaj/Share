GPOs do not provide a mechanism for real-time processing or automated analysis of logs; they can only control what gets logged but not process those logs in real-time. Real-time analysis requires additional tools like SIEM, which continuously monitors and analyzes security-related events in real-time. Task Scheduler can be used as a basic alternative for automation, but it doesn't offer full real-time analysis capabilities.
