I want you to write powershell code that takes the variable ISO_PATH which is set to \\10.10.21.84\share\pipe\E-Team\Windows\Test-WS22\5.5.5\20231012-151433\EXPORT-Test-WS22-5.5.5-20231012-151433.iso and create a new variable called ISO_PARENT_PATH_SLASH and set that to \\10.10.21.84\share\pipe\E-Team\Windows\Test-WS22\5.5.5\20231012-151433\ by doing string manuplation with ISO_PATH.
There will also be avariable created called ISO_PARENT_PATH which should be set to \\10.10.21.84\share\pipe\E-Team\Windows\Test-WS22\5.5.5\20231012-151433.

How would the powershell code look like?
