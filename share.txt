1.	When I run docker run -it --net=host -v //c/:/mnt/c --name fortify 10.10.81.18:5000/devsecops/runners/fortify_mvn:latest /bin/bash it creates a docker container.  If I exit out of the docker container and run the command again, it says the container is already in use.  Is there a way I can reuse the container without having to delete it from docker desktop again?
