I am stigging a bitnami/postgres image by adding commands in a dockerfile that refers to the image. Then I build it, run it and verify my changes.

How would I implement the following stig?
STIG ID: V-214052
RULE Title: PostgreSQL must integrate with an organization-level authentication/access mechanism providing account management and automation for all users, groups, roles, and any other principals.

FIX TEXT: 
Note: The following instructions use the PGDATA environment variable. See supplementary content APPENDIX-F for instructions on configuring PGDATA.

Integrate PostgreSQL security with an organization-level authentication/access mechanism providing account management for all users, groups, roles, and any other principals.

As the database administrator (shown here as "postgres"), edit pg_hba.conf authentication file:

$ sudo su - postgres
$ vi ${PGDATA?}/pg_hba.conf

For each PostgreSQL-managed account that is not documented and approved, either transfer it to management by the external mechanism, or document the need for it and obtain approval, as appropriate.
