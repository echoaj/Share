I am tasked with implementing stigs within a dockerfile. This docker file pulls from a bitnami/postgresql:14.2.0 image.

The STIG I am implementing is V-214056.  Here is the Fix Test:

Note: The following instructions use the PGDATA environment variable. See supplementary content APPENDIX-F for instructions on configuring PGDATA.

As the database administrator (shown here as "postgres"), edit pg_hba.conf authentication file and change all entries of "password" to "md5":

$ sudo su - postgres
$ vi ${PGDATA?}/pg_hba.conf
host all all .example.com md5

What would I put in my dockerfile to implement this stig?
