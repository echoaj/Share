For Req9 the entity that completed is a little unclear.  I'm interpreting it as "the process or user that concluded the action listed by the event log"

For req 7 and 9 there isn't a definitive filed that specifies the entity for initializing and completing event, however I think it is inferred by the nature of the event log.  I think in most cases the Entity that initiates the event (i.e req 7) is the same as the one that completes the event.  

Example 1: A user initiates a login process by entering credentials, the same user process finishes by logging in successfully. 

Example 2: An application initiates the file creation process through a PowerShell command, that same application process finishes writing data to it and closing it.

By this logic it is safe to say that "Source" field listed in the screenshot below complete the requirement

No Further Implementation Needed
