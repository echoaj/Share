Subject: Update on Patching Workflow

Hi Keith,

I wanted to provide a quick update to ensure we’re aligned on the current status and responsibilities regarding the patching process.

Background Context:
For the past several months, I’ve been compiling a ZIP file containing WSUS patches and sharing it with the team on a monthly basis. Each month, I email them the location of the ZIP file.

However, it appears they haven’t been utilizing our patches, so Joseph recently reached out to request the scripts needed to integrate these patches into their existing WSUS. Today, I provided Joseph with the script and included a tutorial video explaining how to upload the patches.

Current Workflow:
	•	My responsibility is to:
	1.	Compile the necessary patches into a ZIP file.
	2.	Upload the ZIP file to Nexus.
	3.	Share the Nexus location via email.
	•	From that point forward, the team handles the following steps:
	1.	Running the scripts to integrate the patches into their WSUS.
	2.	Using their WSUS to update all Windows machines as required.

Since I don’t have direct access to their infrastructure, SEL, or internal systems, my role concludes after providing the ZIP file and necessary instructions.

Let me know if you have any questions or need additional details.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
