I am stigging a bitnami/postgres image by adding commands in a dockerfile that refers to the image. Then I build it, run it and verify my changes.

How would I implement the following stig?
STIG ID: V-214148
RULE Title: PostgreSQL must prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions, to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures.

FIX TEXT: 
"Configure PostgreSQL security to protect all privileged functionality. 

If pl/R and pl/Python are used, document their intended use, document users that have access to pl/R and pl/Python, as well as their business use case, such as data-analytics or data-mining. Because of the risks associated with using pl/R and pl/Python, their use must have AO risk acceptance.

To remove unwanted extensions, use:

DROP EXTENSION <extension_name>

To remove unwanted privileges from a role, use the REVOKE command. 

See the PostgreSQL documentation for more details: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-revoke.html"
