My 2023 Goals
Adopt a strategic mindset.
I want to be able to be a more strategic thinker. Want to carve out time to think about my tasks, future goals. 

I have already scheduled 1 hour a month to take a step back and think of how I can modify my approach to technical and non-technical tasks to improve efficiency.

Immersing myself into NG culture

Being supportive to my fellow engineers. Recognizing others for their contributions. Embracing communication with others. Challenging myself to be more social and reach out to folks.

Learning new skills(s)

Technical examples: Ansible, AWS EC2, Kubernetes, Docker

Non-Technical examples: Creativity, Time Management, Communication

Teach others what I have learned

Put aside time each month to help others

Whenever there are times where you feel you can help others even if they don't ask for helps, reach out to them and assist them with the topics they are learning and working on
