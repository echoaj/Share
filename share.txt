I am going to talk about a person named Zaid at my work that I am having a hard time dealing with.  This person causes me a lot of stress in my life. I want you to analyze the text below and write an essay describing his narcassistc behavious and the ramification that this causes.

Zaid is my team lead at Northrop Grumman, we have a cyber team with a group of 4 people including him.  We all have the same boss. Our boss is James Waren and we have coeworkers that we work with like Alex Vu, Aldo, Tony ect...  Zaid is a person that expresses confidence and charm when you first meet him.  He will buy you things, tell you compliments but judges you behind you back.  He will often bad mouth you the very next day and point out the small mannerism a person does to point fun at them.  He expresses narcassistic tendancies and below are occasions with time stamps of events that have taken place that show his inapporiate behavious.

Always makes the excuse that this project was “dumped” on him, even now.
Alex Vu assigned a ticket to Zaid to create the PowerPoint for the phase 2 demo.  Zaid was hesitant and later assigned the ticket to me.
Continuously asks us for our “status” and never shares his “status” so we don’t know what he is working on.  Likes to boss us around and give us “marching orders”.
Definitely does not work 10 hours a day Mon – Fri.  Most of the time he clocks in around 9am and leaves at 3pm or 4pm at the latest.
In our Jira meets we are the ones telling Zaid what tickets to create rather than Zaid guiding our team on the future work that needs to be done. 
Does not like to lead Jira meeting.  Mostly me or Aldo conducting them and creating stories.

I created a ticket assigned to Zaid for on boarding Tony.  This ticket involved unblocking him so he can get the accounts he needs access to.  Zaid diverted that work for me or Aldo to do.  Tony later ended up doing it himself.
2/8/23
I asked him if he could help us with the PowerPoint, Zaid didn’t want to.
 
Later during a meeting with Jason, Jason was giving our team tips on what to put for the “Vision” portion of the ppt and Zaid during the meeting said “you got that Alex?” as if trying to insinuate that I would be doing that portion of the PowerPoint.  I told him “no, you go it.” Zaid finally did some work and completed that slide, but he did complain afterward that it took him 80 minutes to finish.

During a meeting I was shocked to find out that Zaid was barely asking us how to sign into VMware Horizon to use vCenter, when everyone on the team has been using vCenter for over a month.
2/15/23
We had a meeting I believe around 2pm about the preparing for the upcoming demo and working on the demo.  While he was in the meeting, he was getting a haircut. 
2/21/23
Had a big argument during a zoom meeting about my request for him to give us his status as well when he asks for ours.  He says we report to him, and he doesn’t need to give his status to us.  Also, later when I had a 1 on 1 with him, he said the reason why he types so slow is because he looks at this keyboard when he types.  That he is taking classes to learn how to type without looking that the keyboard.  Says his first time ever touching a computer was in 2010. Says he likely has the highest IT certification in all of Northrop Grumman, taking $7000 red hat Linux certification currently.

I was leading a meeting regarding the transition from Kanban to Scrum.  I was getting everyone’s opinion about which meetings we should create, how often, ect...  I made a confluence page about it.  After we were done, I asked Zaid if he could create those meetings, and ask James and/or Shai about what metric we should use for pointing.  To my surprise Zaid called me after the meeting and asked if I was stressed. I told him no.  To summarize the hour 1 hour conversation, Zaid was offended that I told him to create the meetings and ask about the story points and I think he didn’t like my tone of voice either when I said it.  My guess is that he felt embarrassed since he is the team lead. He also alluded that I think I am “hot shit” and know it all.  I asked him if he thinks I am bossy, in a hesitated manner he said no.  Also he told me how he doesn’t like Alex Vu and one time said “something” to his face.  Not sure what he said to Alex, but I am sure it was related to his character.  I felt pretty bad after the meeting, and could not focus at all the following day.  I told Joylynn about what happened, and she made me feel a lot better.  I also mentioned the conversation Zaid and I had to Aldo and Aldo said I’ve been an amazing team member but just to be careful of what I say in front of Zaid especially when I am leading the team.  Aldo says he doesn’t know what Zaid’s role is on the team.  I also agree with Aldo, since Zaid doesn’t lead or do much work it is hard to know what his role is.  By far he is the person one our team that knows the least about how our pipeline works.

There was an after work social gathering at Karl Strauss Brewing Company.  We were all sitting at a table and Zaid got up to do something.  As he was coming back to the table, Aldo was about to ask Zaid a question.  The moment, Aldo started to speak, Zaid gets really close to his face and says “fuck you” and starts to talk about something else.  I didn’t find it particularly funny and the look on Aldo’s face was of confusion and surprise.

Zaid basically asks all of us to send him our mid-year review before sending it off to James.  He wants to basically copy of ours so he could create his own.

I was driving Aldo, Tony, and Zaid to get some lunch and there were 3 girls crossing the crosswalk.  As I was slowing down to a stop, Zaid shoves his head out the window and cat calls the girls, telling them that they are very beautiful or something like that.  To the rest of us in the car agreed that they appeared to be high school girls.  Regardless this is sexual harassment.  It is not the first time he has done this.  The first day I met Zaid, he took me to subway and as we where eating at the table there were two women walking by the parking lot and he catcalled them.  It was embarrassing to me.

Zaid is very rude in the way he messages me.

Today he made a lot of snarky comments toward me during meetings.  In the software standup I had asked David Loring about izpack since I had scanned it with fortify and it had over 350+ vulnerabilities.  I had asked if this was an open-source repo they had forked since I remember seeing it before.  They actually didn’t know izpack was there and ultimately determined that likely a previous developer forked it just as reference. Then they said it could be deleted.  Zaid joins the meeting.  Then a few other people gave their status and Rodolfo Chen had stated that he found a fix with an issue they had with izpack.   So Zaid at the end asked if since Rodolfo Chen found a work around will it be used on the inside.  David said yes but that likely they would get rid of the parts they don’t need.   Zaid in the meeting basically expressed that when he heard me ask the question, he ran all the way to building 6A to get more clarification and because of his action we determined that after all a portion of izpack will be going in the inside.  The way he framed it made it sound like he was a hero for doing this and his heroic actions cleaned up the mess I almost made by asking that question.  He then went straight to my cubicle after the meeting to reiterate his heroic action and said he would send me a list of question to help guide me on how to ask proper and better questions to developers.
The second thing that happened was that Tony determined there were COTS that were not updated on the WSUS.  Because of that Zaid came straight to my cubicle with Tony basically interrogating me on why that is.  I didn’t even know there where COTS on the WSUS since I thought I remember creating it from an empty WS2022 template.  We had a meeting with everyone to figure this out and Zaid made comments to me like “I thought you where keeping track of this”, “At least 1 person on this team knows about this”,  “I am surprised you weren’t keeping track of this”.  I was having trouble focusing in the meeting because I was stressed out and Zaid was like “you got that Alex!?”,  “Are you sleeping”?
I don’t mind taking ownership of my mistakes or getting guidance from others but what I can’t stand is hearing these types of snarky comments on a daily basis.  It is stressful and I can’t concentrate if I am constantly thinking if Zaid at any moment will come to my cubicle and criticize my work.
