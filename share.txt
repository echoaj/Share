While there is no single GPO that directly controls the processing of local audit logs by specific events of interest, you can achieve this by configuring Advanced Audit Policies in the Group Policy Editor to focus on particular event categories such as Logon/Logoff, Account Management, or Object Access. Once logs are generated, you can use Event Viewer to create custom views or filters to isolate and review specific events, like failed logon attempts (Event ID 4625). Additionally, tools like Task Scheduler can be configured to trigger actions based on particular event IDs, allowing you to further process or respond to specific audit events. These methods allow for tailored auditing and log processing for specific security needs.
