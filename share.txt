I have this Jira Ticket called "[Verification] Log Forwarding - Log Management - Windows Operating System Workstation"

The reiquirement is the following:
Req1.  The Windows Operating System Workstation shall forward its logs to the centralized log collection location.

How do I check to make sure this works. Also I am not sure if the centralized log collection location it's talking about is event viewer or splunk because I know our company uses splunk as well but not sure what it is reffering to.  what do you think?
