I have a Jira ticket in which I am suppose to verify if IAM software does auditing. The name of the ticket is "Auditing of User Accounts and Groups - Role Based Access - IAM Software".
In this case, IAM Software refers to Active Directory.  We have a lot of different computers and vms under this domain.  How do I verify the following requirements.  I know they are kind of braud but give it your best shot.

- Req1. The IAM software shall allow for auditing of domain group accounts.
- Req2. The IAM software shall allow for auditing of domain user accounts.
