I want to create an ansible role that installs vmware workcenter pro on a windows 10 machine.
In the ansible role task I create a temporary directory, download workcenter there, and I need help to then install it.
This is what I have so far:

---
- name: Create Temporary Directory
  ansible.builtin.win_file:
    path: "{{ windows_temp_directory }}"
    state: directory

- name: Download Workstation Installer
  include_role:
    name: devops-ansible-library
    tasks_from: download_repo_file
  vars: 
    file_repository_file: '{{ windows_workstation_installer_exe }}'
    file_repository_path: '{{ windows_workstation_url_path }}/'
    file_repository_download_directory: "{{ windows_temp_directory }}"


- name: Install Workstation exe
  ansible.builtin.win_shell: '{{ windows_temp_directory }}{{ windows_workstation_installer_exe }} /qn'


# Pausing to allow the workstation to install, otherwise it won't delete the temp directory
- name: Pause To Allow Install to Finish
  ansible.builtin.pause:
    seconds: 60

What would the ansible code look like to install workcenter
I want to accept the license agreement, check on enhanced keyboard driver, uncheck "check for product updates", uncheck "join vmware customer experience", leave create desktop shorcut turned on, leave start menu programs folder turned on, then press the install button, also I don't want the vm to restart after if finsihes downloading.  

How would the ansible look like to complete this
