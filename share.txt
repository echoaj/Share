I have a gitlab pipeline that has ci code to upload an artifact to nexus.  The artifact is around 5.1GB big. The code looks like this:

nexus-upload-wim: 
  stage: nexus-wim
  tags:
    - win10gitlabrunner

  script: 
    - |
      $UPLOAD_URL = "$BASE_URL/$END_POINT"
      Write-Host "Uploading Wim to Nexus"
      Write-Host $UPLOAD_URL

      $URI = New-Object System.Uri($UPLOAD_URL)
      $PWD = ConvertTo-SecureString $NEXUS_TOKEN_PASS -AsPlainText -Force
      $creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($NEXUS_TOKEN_NAME, $PWD)

      Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $URI -InFile $WIM_PATH -Method Put -Credential $creds
      Write-Host Complete


The terminal output looks like this:

==> vsphere-clone.windows: Waiting for IP...
==> vsphere-clone.windows: IP address: 192.168.5.114
==> vsphere-clone.windows: Using WinRM communicator to connect: 192.168.5.114
==> vsphere-clone.windows: Waiting for WinRM to become available...

The issue is it just hangs and doesn't ever complete.  I was able to get it to work on a RHEL gitlab runner using Curl but I've had no luck using Invoke-WebRequest or Invoke-RestMethod.  What could be the issue?
