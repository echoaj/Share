I am stigging a bitnami/postgres image by adding commands in a dockerfile that refers to the image. Then I build it, run it and verify my changes.

How would I implement the following stig?
STIG ID: V-214075
FIX TEXT: Develop, document, and implement procedures to restrict and track use of the PostgreSQL software installation account.
