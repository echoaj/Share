I have a gitlab pipeline that consists of an a .gitlab.ci.yml, which runs "ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml"
In the playbook I have:
[windows]
192.168.5.45       

[windows:vars]
ansible_user = Admin...
ansible_password = Pass...
ansible_connection = winrm
ansible_winrm_port = 5986
ansible_winrm_transport = basic
become_user = Administrator
become_flags = "logon_type=interactive logon_flags=with_profile"
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation = ignore
ansible_winrm_read_timeout_sec = 60

Then I have a playbook.yml with 
---
- name: Calling Windows Role
  hosts: windows
  gather_facts: true
  roles:
    - role : windows

Then within the windows folder I have a tasks folder with a few rolls.  one of them copies a powershell file and executes it on the target virtual machine defined in the playbook.

Every time I run the pipeline I need to edit the inventory file to change the ip address for the target machine.  
But what I want to do is, I want to define the IP address of that machine within the .gitlab-ci.yml file instead and have ansible use that IP address.  Is this possible?
Can that ip address define within the .gitlab-ci.yml be passed to the inventory file?
Do I even need an inventory file?
Do I need the playbook.yml?
What's the best solution to acheive this if possible?
