I am trying to figure out how to structure my ansible repository.

In the top level I have my inventory.ini file that defines ip addresses for Windows 10, Windows Server, and Linux.
In the top level I also have an hbss.yaml file that has this written in it:
- name: Run the HBSS role
  hosts:
    - windows_workstation
    - windows_server
    - linux
  roles:
    - hbss

I am purposely passing in those hosts.
Then I have a folder called hbss (that is the role hbss.yaml is calling) in the top level that contains a folder for defaults, handlers, tasks, tests, vars, README.md
What I need help with is within the tasks files.  Let's say I want to create a create-directory.yaml for windows 10, windows server, and linux. obviously creating a directory for bash is different than for powershell.
Would I need to create 3 different create-directory.yaml files one for each system?
Would I need to create some kind of conditional that determines which create-directory.yaml file to execute based on the host type?
How would you recommend I go about this?
