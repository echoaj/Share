We have a Trellix ePO environemnet set up with a few managed client machines that have Trellix Agent installed.
We also have over 50 requirements that I must figure out if the they make sense, or don't make sense in the context of Trellix.
"HBSS Software" in this case is Trellix.  If they don't make sense, I need to justify why.  
It may also be the case the requirement is poorly written and needs further clarification
If the requirement does make sense I need to know how.
For example I need to know what Trellix product the requirement that makese sense pertains to.  
For example, a requirement that is about anti virus would likely pertain to Trellix endpoint securtiy.
