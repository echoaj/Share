To boot from a Windows 10 disk, you need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS or UEFI settings so that it prioritizes booting from the CD/DVD drive. Here are the general steps:

1. **Insert the Windows 10 Disk**: Place your Windows 10 disk into the CD/DVD drive of your computer.

2. **Restart Your Computer**: If it's on, shut it down and then turn it back on.

3. **Access BIOS/UEFI Settings**: 
   - As soon as the computer starts, press the key to enter BIOS or UEFI settings. This key varies by manufacturer but is often one of the following: `F2`, `F10`, `F12`, `DEL`, or `ESC`.
   - You usually see a message like “Press [Key] to enter setup” at the bottom of the screen for a brief moment during startup.

4. **Change the Boot Order**:
   - Navigate to the boot order settings in BIOS/UEFI. This section might be named "Boot Order," "Boot Priority," or something similar.
   - Set the CD/DVD drive as the first boot device. This can usually be done by using the arrow keys to highlight the CD/DVD drive and then using keys like `+` or `-` to move it up the order.

5. **Save and Exit**:
   - After changing the boot order, save the changes and exit the BIOS/UEFI. This is typically done by pressing `F10` or selecting the “Save and Exit” option.

6. **Boot from the Disk**:
   - Your computer should now restart and attempt to boot from the Windows 10 disk.
   - You might see a message like “Press any key to boot from CD or DVD.” Press a key to proceed.

7. **Follow Installation Prompts**:
   - After successfully booting from the disk, you should see the Windows 10 installation setup. Follow the prompts to install Windows 10.

If you encounter issues, make sure the disk is not damaged and that your optical drive is functioning properly. Also, ensure that your computer meets the system requirements for Windows 10.
