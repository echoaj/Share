Certainly! To create a bootable CD that will allow you to deploy your custom Windows 10 image (`myos.wim`), you'll need to use Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE) as the bootable environment. Here are the steps:

### Requirements

1. **Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK)**: Download and install the Windows ADK from the Microsoft website, specifically the Deployment Tools and Windows Preinstallation Environment components.
2. **A blank CD**: Ensure you have a blank CD and a CD burner.
3. **Your `myos.wim` file**: Have your custom Windows 10 image (`myos.wim`) accessible.

### Steps

1. **Install Windows ADK and WinPE**:
   - Download and install the Windows ADK and the Windows PE add-on from Microsoft’s website.
   - During installation, select the Deployment Tools and Windows Preinstallation Environment.

2. **Create a WinPE Media**:
   - Open the Deployment and Imaging Tools Environment as an administrator. You can find it in the Start menu under Windows Kits, inside the Windows ADK section.
   - Run the following command to create a working copy of the Windows PE files:
     ```
     copype amd64 C:\WinPE_amd64
     ```
     (Use `amd64` for 64-bit or `x86` for 32-bit systems. Adjust the path as needed.)

3. **Add Your Custom WIM File to WinPE**:
   - Copy `myos.wim` into the `C:\WinPE_amd64\media\sources` folder.
   - Rename `myos.wim` to `boot.wim` for simplicity, if desired.

4. **Create a Bootable CD**:
   - In the Deployment and Imaging Tools Environment, navigate to your WinPE working directory (`C:\WinPE_amd64`).
   - Run the following command to create an ISO file from the WinPE media:
     ```
     MakeWinPEMedia /ISO C:\WinPE_amd64 C:\WinPE_amd64\WinPE_amd64.iso
     ```
   - Use a tool like ImgBurn or Windows Disc Image Burner to burn the ISO file to your blank CD.

5. **Boot and Apply the WIM File**:
   - Insert the CD into the target computer and boot from it.
   - Once booted into WinPE, open a command prompt.
   - Use the `DISM` command to apply the WIM file to your desired drive. For example:
     ```
     dism /apply-image /imagefile:D:\sources\boot.wim /index:1 /applydir:C:\
     ```
     (Here, `D:` is your CD drive and `C:` is the target partition.)

6. **Configure Boot Loader**:
   - After applying the image, configure the bootloader:
     ```
     bcdboot C:\Windows
     ```
     (Adjust the drive letter if your Windows installation is on a different drive.)

7. **Finalize and Restart**:
   - Once the bootloader is configured, you can remove the CD and restart the computer.
   - The computer should now boot into your custom Windows 10 installation.

### Notes

- Ensure that your target computer’s hardware is compatible with your custom Windows 10 image.
- Backup any important data on the target computer before applying the new image.
- This process will overwrite the existing operating system on the target partition.
